# Kpop-Analysis

## Data Collection
- I had to do a little bit of googling to find the dataset. After some searching, I came across this website with an excel file. Itâ€™s a survey conducted for a study on social media and K-pop which I found very interesting. I liked the questions they asked and I also liked that the survey was conducted recently.
The dataset contains 240 K-pop fans from all over the world and there were 22 survey questions.
